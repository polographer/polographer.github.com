Like everything in life all is a cycle, everything that is new becomes old and the old becomes new again. Seems like the guys on imprint.to abandon their platform when I was about to publish my new awesome post, and I'm platform-less again.

It's a first world problem, nothing to create a gofundme campaign, but seems like I have to take care of the issue myself (since you probably know my rant with Medium).

So, I'm taking full advantage of GitHub pages and going to create my handmade blog with help of Jekyll, which I know is cheating, but you know developers; we occasionally take shortcuts.

So go on, indulge yourself (that's right, kick off your shoes), and don't forget to follow me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/polographer), or if you are [old-fashioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_fashioned_(cocktail)) (but refined), bookmark this page.

Polo.
