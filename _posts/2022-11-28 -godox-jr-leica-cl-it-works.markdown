### godox lux junior + leica CL = it works

I've been looking for an answer on the internet, but it seems that the godox has never been tested in the wild with the Leica CL; I took the bullet and I buy it, you know the reviews say the lux is a great manual flash, they are right, but paired with the CL, it's just an amazing and compact combo.

Short story; it works. Long story, it looks amazing.
