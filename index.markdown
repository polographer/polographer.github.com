### Hello
My name is Marco (Polo) Ornelas, I'm a developer/photographer living in NOVA area. For more information about my work please read below: 

### Developer

Software Developer Manager. My main focus is web development but I like and everything connected to the internet (mobile, servers, web, IoT, etc), my preferred work environment is on a Mac but I can work on any *NIX platform (even Windows with WSL2). I'm currently using an iPad Pro as my daily driver augmented with a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W for development

I love to learn new technology and hack all my computer-related stuff, I prefer tomatoWRT over stock firmware but discovered MerlinWRT for Asus hardware. I have a nvidia jetson for learning about AI and a "particle argon" that reminds me that I can do hardware but it's not my strongest point.

Iâ€™m a firm believer that curiosity drives this world to a better future.

### Photography
I only work on personal projects, using digital, 35mm, Holga, and some polaroid, I like all formats but the future is digital. See my portfolio [here](http://photo.poloornelas.mx) and follow me at [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/polographer/)
