### Hello
My name is Polo Ornelas aka. Marco Polo Ornelas Alfaro, I'm a developer/photographer living in Reston, Virginia. For more information about my work visits the sites below: 

### Developer

Full stack developer and Team Lead. Interested on mobile development and everything connected, my preferred work enviroment is on a *NIX platform, I can work on windows but only as a dumb terminal (I have tested the WSL but its not ready -yet-). I recently changed my daily driver from Mac and I got a pixelbook, so far; I'm happy to don't relay on Apple anymore and I love the Pen BUT iphone is still the king.
I love to learn new technology and I usually hack all my computer related stuff, I prefer tomatoWRT over stock firmwares, I have a raspberry Pi with a lot of network services like OpenVPN Server and I have a particle core that remind me why I can do hardware but it's not my strongest point. Iâ€™m a firm believer that curiosity drives this world to a better future.

Not doing too much comercial photography but instead working on personal projects, I have take photography courses over my life with great teachers but and also learning the hard way. I shoot digital, 35mm, holga and some polaroid, to be honest I like all formats but the future is digital.
