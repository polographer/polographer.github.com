### Hello
My name is Marco (Polo) Ornelas, I'm a developer/photographer living in NOVA area. For more information about my work please visit the sites below: 

### Developer

Software Developer Manager. My main focus is web development but I like and everything connected to the internet (mobile, servers, web, IoT, etc), my preferred work environment is on a Mac but I can work on any *NIX platform (even Windows with WSL2). I'm currently using an iPad as my daily driver augmented with an NVidia Jetson to do development

I love to learn new technology and I usually hack all my computer-related stuff, I prefer tomatoWRT over stock firmware but I recently discover MerlinWRT and I think I got a winner. I have a Raspberry Pi for development on-the-go and I have a "particle argon" that reminds me that I can do hardware but it's not my strongest point. 

Iâ€™m a firm believer that curiosity drives this world to a better future.

### Opinions
I've always tried to document somewhere my findings and my opinions on some sort of blog, right now I'm settled on 
[Imprint.to](https://polographer.imprint.to/).

### Photography
Not doing too much commercial photography but instead working on personal projects, I have taken photography courses over my life with great teachers but and also learning the hard way. I shoot digital, 35mm, Holga, and some polaroid, I like all formats but the future is digital.
